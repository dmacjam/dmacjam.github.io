I attended the **11th ACM Recommender Systems conference (RecSys 2017)** which is leading international conference focused on research in recommender systems. 

At the conference, I presented long paper **Educational Question Routing in Online Student Communities**<!--more-->, which is based on my Master’s thesis advised by Ivan Srba. In short, we created novel recommender system applicable in education which recommends new question to students, who are most appropriate to answer them. In cooperation with Harvard University, we evaluated the recommender system in discussion tool [Askalot](https://github.com/AskalotCQA/askalot) used by more than 4600 students from 147 countries during an online course at the [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:CaltechDelftX+QuCryptox+3T2016), one of the leading MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) provider. This type and scale of experiment brings several interesting results which I described during my 25-minute presentation at the main stage.

The conference took place in _Como_, a city in north Italy few kilometers from swiss borders. Conference venue was located close to lake Como near beautiful Villa Erba which is well-known architectural and historical spot. In my opinion, tasty food and perfect cup of espresso coffee make Italy brilliant place to attend a conference. Moreover, commuting to the conference by boat was very special and it offers so many nice views on lake surroundings with colorful houses in small villages up on the hills.

To conclude, RecSys 2017 conference was great experience for me. I got the opportunity to present our research in front of international community, received useful feedback and got new interesting ideas. I learned about current research areas and state-of-the-art solutions in recommendation domain used in academia as well in industry (companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft and many others). What’s more, I got to know several interesting researchers from dream IT companies and well-known universities. This whole RecSys experience gave me further motivation to keep doing research in the future.
